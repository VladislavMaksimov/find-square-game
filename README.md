## find-square-game

A simple game about finding the square that has a different color than the rest. You have a board with a grid of random colored squares. When you click on the right square, the number of the squares is rising, the colors are changing and the right and the wrong colors are getting closer to each other. If you click on the wrong square or the time is up, the game is over. Your progress is saving even if you close the browser.
